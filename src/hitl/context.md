## Purpose
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interface for reviewing, correcting, and approving LLM-generated intelligence reports. Provides Streamlit utilities for the multi-page dashboard application.

## Architecture Role
Quality assurance layer between LLM report generation and final publication. Enables human analysts to review reports, provide corrections, and submit feedback that improves future LLM prompts. Phase 5 of the intelligence pipeline.
